# The store app for EBEC Competition
Design and implementation of the system for the international European BEST Engineering Competition – an interactive online store simulator that allows managing inventory of items and products used by EBEC participants to carry out a competition task.  
The application was implemented in 2019 during the national EBEC final in Gliwice and the local stage in Wrocław.  
The system is constantly developed and has already been prepared for this year's (cancelled) edition. The store was to be used during the local stage in 6 cities in Poland, the nationwide stage and the international final in Warsaw.
